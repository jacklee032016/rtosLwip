			README for UART/USART and stdio
												Feb.24th, 2018 		Jack Lee			

												
STD IO based on UART/USART in BSP
		Lowest layer: UART/USART driver;
		Second Layer: serial.h, encapsulated details of UART/USART
		
		Application Layer: stdio_serial.h
				provides initializing interface	for UART or USART;
				Abstract access to serial port with: stdio_base and 2 function pointers: ptr_put, ptr_get;
				
				Defaultly, RTOS access 
				
		Standard C libary:
				read.c and write.c: implement standard C fucntion of read(int fd, )	and write(int fd);
				
		
		LibC or no libc		
			No matter with or without libc, read()/write() is interface with the std io functions;
			
			When no libc
					stdio.c: 
								when libc is not used, this file implements 'xxprintf' to output string only;
								No input from this file;
			When Libc:					
					When nano C library is used, this file is not needed, same functions are provided by nano C;


Notes:
		bootloader without libc support, only a tiny stdio, so some formats in printf() can't be used. 
		For example "%lu"	and "%ld" are not parsed by stdio, so "%u" and "%d" only be used;
